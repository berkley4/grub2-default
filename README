This script lists the grub2 menu entries and allows you to select which one
to boot by default. It automagically sets the menu number(s) in the 
GRUB_DEFAULT entry in /etc/default/grub.

The script was written after spending some time trying to google a solution 
to what should be an easy task. It should hopefully work on most setups, but 
no guarantees.
